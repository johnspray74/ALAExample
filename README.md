# ALAExample

ALAExample is a sample of a research project for a software Reference Architecture called ALA [(Abstraction Layered Architecture)](abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com).
Abstraction Layered Architecture is theretically optimized for the maintainabilty quality attribute.
This research was to measure if this is true in paractice.

The example Windows desktop application procides inter-communication between a hyperthetical device, the user interface, disk files.

This example code is just used to show how an ALA diagram, Domain Abstractions, Programming Paradigms and WireTo work.

## Work-in-progress

It is a work-in-progress to make it build and run.
Will need a device simulator to run without a real device on the com port.
Swift and Java versions to follow.
