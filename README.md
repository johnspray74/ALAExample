# DataLinkALASample

DataLink_ALA is a research project for a software Reference Architecture called ALA [(Abstraction Layered Architecture)](abstractionlayeredarchitecture.com).
Abstraction Layered Architecture is theretically optimized for the maintainabilty quality attribute.
This research was to measure if this is true in paractice.

The project was a rewrite of a Windows desktop application that provides inter-communication between farmers devices, the user, disk files and various cloud destinations.
This ALA version is to get a comparison with legacy conventionally written code.
If the new application becomes commercial, there will be on-going opportunity to compare the maintanabilty between the old and new.

This repository is just a sample of that project's code to be used as a reference to show how the diagram, Domain Abstractions, Programming Paradigms and WireTo work.

## Work-in-progress

It is a work-in-progress to make it build and run as it was cut down from the full project.
Will need a device simulator to run without a real device on the com port.
Swift and Andriod versions to follow.
